| [x] | Documentation | Explain setup, APIs, Redis, Celery, and demo operation | `README.md`, `web/README.md`, `docs/` |
| [ ] | Repository cleanup | Delete obsolete placeholders and compatibility code | Entire repository |
| [ ] | Demo packaging cleanup | Move standalone demo behavior out of the reusable AgentGate package if still appropriate | `src/agentgate/demo/`, `examples/` |

## Deferred Production Capabilities

- PostgreSQL migration and high-availability Redis.
- Authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, quotas, and audit integration.
- Dependency-based evaluator short-circuiting with explicit blocked/skipped Results and
  `blocked_by_evaluator_id` provenance.
- Priority queues, tenant fairness, multiple worker pools, and resource-aware routing.
- Recurring schedules, scheduling priorities, and calendar rules.
- Immediate interruption of arbitrary blocking Target calls and persisted per-attempt
  cancellation history.
- Customer-specific Java scheduler and Agent-platform adapters.
- Production observability platform integrations and external Result callbacks.
- Automated resume or retry of partially completed Runs.
- Persisted per-attempt retry history and retry events in Traces; the POC stores only the
  successful execution Trace.
- Persisted A/B identity, pair history, and A/B-specific lineage after the POC.
- Semantic or embedding-based failure clustering.
- Persisted Optimization Reports and cross-Run history.
- Suggestion review and application lifecycle.
- Automatic regression Run creation from accepted suggestions.

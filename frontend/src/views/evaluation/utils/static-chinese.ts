  'Both skills involve processing loan applications, but with distinct primary responsibilities: Credit Inquiry focuses on retrieving risk classification, while Loan Approval involves assessing and choosing an approval action. The latter may implicitly require or include risk classification, creating an intersection, but routing can be clear based on whether the user specifically requests risk retrieval or a broader assessment/decision.':
    '两个技能都处理贷款申请，但主要职责不同：征信查询负责获取风险分类，贷款审批负责评估并选择审批动作。贷款审批可能隐含需要风险分类，因此职责存在交集；可根据用户需要的是风险查询还是综合评估与决策来明确路由。',
  'Clarify if Loan Approval always includes a risk classification step, or if Credit Inquiry is a sub-task. Consider routing based on explicit user intent: specific risk requests to Credit Inquiry, and general assessment/approval requests to Loan Approval.':

    '两个技能都处理贷款申请：征信查询侧重获取风险分类，贷款审批侧重评估申请并选择审批动作。审批评估可能需要风险分类，因此职责存在交集；若将征信查询定位为独立的数据查询步骤、贷款审批定位为综合决策过程，路由仍可保持清晰。',

  'Handle my loan request': '处理我的贷款请求',
  "Both skills involve processing loan applications, but their declared responsibilities are distinct: one retrieves a risk classification, while the other assesses the application and chooses an approval action. The assessment in 'Loan Approval' likely depends on the risk classification from 'Credit Inquiry', indicating a sequential or dependent relationship rather than a direct conflict or duplication.":
